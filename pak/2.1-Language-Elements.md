# 2.1 Language Elements

The fundamental parts used to construct other PAK parts.

Also known as _PAK Kernel Components_.

Components
----------

Are the building blocks of Parts and Kits.

![](img/PAK-BasicComponent.jpg)

A **component** has one or more **inputs** and one or more **outputs**.

### Inputs



### Outputs

When enough inputs values are available to perform its function, it produces its
outputs according to its intended logic and changes its status to "ready".

Simple Values
-------------

Every value in PAK is represented by a **string** of characters encoded as UTF-8
text.

The **null string** is a string with no (zero) characters.

### Numeric Values

Numbers are represented as strings and are used in mathematical operations.

The numeric value of a string is deduced by extracting decimal digits (0 to
9) from left to right until a non-decimal digit is encountered.

Numeric strings may be prefixed by "+" or "-" characters.

A decimal point "." may separate the fractionary part of a real number.

 
#### *Examples*:

| String        | Numeric Value |
|---------------|---------------|
| "1"           | 1             |
| "-3x4"        | \-3           |
| "007"         | 7             |
| "ABC"         | 0             |
| ""            | 0             |
| "2,023,000"   | ​2             |
| "2.500"       | 2.5           |
| "-0.25"       | \-.25         |
| "true"        | 0             |
| "-0"          | 0             |
| "+\-+\-\-55FF" | \-55         |
| "\$16.99"     | 0             |


### Canonical Representation of Numbers

The numeric value result of mathematical operations produced by any PAK component is always represented by its **canonical numeric** form:

- Excess zero digits are removed from the integer part (*"0070" becomes "70"*)
- Excess zero digits are removed from the fractionary part (*"6.500" becomes "6.5"; "2.000" becomes "2"*)
- The zero integer part is removed for real numbers less than 1 and greater than -1 (*"0.75" becomes ".75"*)
- Excess plus signs are removed (*"+384" becomes "384"*)
- Excess minus signs are reduced to a single sign or not, after each inversion (*"\-\-\-33" becomes "-33"; "\-\-22" becomes "22"*)


### Boolean Values

The boolean value is deduced from the numeric interpretation of a string:

-   "0" (zero) is **false**
-   everything else is **true**



Compound Values
---------------

A compound value is composed of an sequence of strings or compound values.

Each element may be referenced by its position, starting with **1**.


### Compound Metapak

For documentation purposes, a compound value may reference another compound
value which helps describe each element.

A Compound Metapak is composed of the **compound name** followed by the sequence
of each **element name**.
