2.1 Language Elements
=====================

The fundamental parts used to construct other PAK parts.

Also known as PAK Kernel Components.

 

Components
----------

Are the building blocks of Parts and Kits.

A **component** has one or more **inputs** and one or more **outputs**.

 

### Inputs

 

### Outputs

When enough inputs values are available to perform its function, it produces its
outputs according to its intended logic and changes its status to "ready".

 

Simple Values
-------------

Every value in PAK is represented by a **string** of characters encoded as UTF-8
text.

 

### Numeric Values

Numbers are represented as strings and are used in mathematical operations.

The numeric value of a string is deduced by extracting its decimal digits (0 to
9) from left to right until a non-decimal digit is encountered.

Numeric strings may be prefixed by "+" or "-" characters.

A decimal point "." may separate the fractionary part of an number.

 

| String        | Numeric Value |
|---------------|---------------|
| "1            | 1             |
| "-4x3"        | \-4           |
| "007"         | 7             |
| "2,023,000"   | ​2             |
| "2.500"       | 2.5           |
| "-0.25"       | \-.25         |
| "true"        | 0             |
| "-0"          | 0             |
| "+-+-+-+55FF" | \-55          |
| "\$16.99"     | 0             |

 

### Boolean Values

The boolean value is deduced from the numeric interpretation of a string:

-   "0" (zero) is **false**

-   everything else is **true**

 

 

Compound Values
---------------

A compound value is composed of an sequence of strings or compound values.

Each element may be referenced by its position, starting with 1.

 

### Compound Metapak

For documentation purposes, a compound value may reference another compound
value which helps describe each element.

 

A Compound Metapak is composed of the **compound name** followed by the sequence
of each **element name**.
