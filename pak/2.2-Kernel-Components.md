title: 2.2 PAK Kernel Components
---

The fundamental components used to construct other PAK parts.

2.2.1 Arithmetic Components
===========================

Provide the mathematical operations upon numerical values, such as:

-   **absolute** to compute the positive value of a number

-   **add**, **subtract**, **multiply**, **divide** to compute the basic
    arithmetic operations

-   **integer** to compute the integer part of a number

-   **modulo** to calculate the remainder of an integer division

-   **max**, **min** to find the larger or smaller value of two numbers

-   **neg** to negate the number

-   **round** to aproximate a numeric value to a number rounded to the desired
    quantity of fractionary digits

2.2.2 String Components
=======================

Perform useful operations for the manipulation of strings, such as:

-   **cat** to concatenate two or more strings

-   **codepoint** to reveal the numerical code point of a Unicode character (see
    also *utf*)

-   **extract** to extract a substring out of a string

-   **find** to find the position of a string inside another string

-   **format** to produce a more readable string out of a string

-   **length** to count the number of characters of a string

-   **lower** to convert all upper case characters in a string to their
    corresponding lower case (see also *upper*)

-   **piece** to extract a substring based on separator characters

-   **pieces** to count the number of pieces of a string

-   **replace** to replace a substring with another substring within a string

-   **translate** to change characters of a string based on a translation table

-   **trim** to remove leading or trailing blanks out of a string

-   **upper** to convert all lower case characters in a string to their
    corresponding upper case (see also *lower*)

-   **utf** to generate the Unicode character from a code point (see also
    *codepoint*)

2.2.3 Compound Components
======================

Provide useful operations for the manipulation of compound strings, also known as **SoS** (_String of Strings_), such as:

- **pack** its several inputs into a SoS.



2.2.4 User Interface Components
======================

Provide mechanisms to interact with the user, receiving input data and exhibit the result of data processing.

-   **input** to receive a string from a connected output component.

-   **output** to make available the result of a computation to connected inputs of other components.


Â 
2.2.5 Control Flow
==================

Provide the mechanisms to control the execution sequence of components, such as:

-   **if** to select a path of execution based on a boolean value condition.

-   **loop** to repeat the computation of a subtree of components by a certain
    number of times an/or while a boolean condition holds true.
