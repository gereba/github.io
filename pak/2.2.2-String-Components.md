The fundamental components used to construct other PAK parts.

2.2.2 String Components
=======================

Perform useful operations for the manipulation of strings, such as:

-   **cat** to concatenate two or more strings

-   **codepoint** to reveal the numerical code point of a Unicode character (see
    also *utf*)

-   **extract** to extract a substring out of a string

-   **find** to find the position of a string inside another string

-   **format** to produce a more readable string out of a string

-   **length** to count the number of characters of a string

-   **lower** to convert all upper case characters in a string to their
    corresponding lower case (see also *upper*)

-   **piece** to extract a substring based on separator characters

-   **pieces** to count the number of pieces of a string

-   **replace** to replace a substring with another substring within a string

-   **translate** to change characters of a string based on a translation table

-   **trim** to remove leading or trailing blanks out of a string

-   **upper** to convert all lower case characters in a string to their
    corresponding upper case (see also *lower*)

-   **utf** to generate the Unicode character from a code point (see also
    *codepoint*)

Cat
---

Concatenates strings (a) and (b) and (c)...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        _________
--->(a)|         |[data]-->
       |   CAT   |
--->(b)|         |
       |         |
--->(c)|         |
       |         |
--->(d)|         |
       |         |
--->(e)|         |
       |         |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### *Examples*

| a        | b        | data          |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| "concat" | "enate"  | "concatenate" |
| "2020"   | "-12-31" | "2020-12-31"  |
| ""       | ""       | ""            |

Extract
-------

Extracts the substring of string (a) **starting** at position (b) and **ending**
at position (c). The first position starts at 1.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        _________
--->(a)|         |[index]-->
       | EXTRACT |
--->(b)|         |
       |         |
--->(c)|         |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Special Cases
-------------

-   If input (c) is absent, only the character at position (b) of string (a) is
    extracted.

-   If inputs (b) and (c) are absent, the first character of string (a) is
    extracted.

-   If (c) is greater than the length of string (a), it is assumed to be equal
    to the length of (a), such that all characters from (b) till the end of (a)
    are extracted.

-   If (b) is greater than (c), the null string ("") is extracted.

-   If (b) or (c) is negative, the position is measured from the end of string
    (a) instead of from the beginning, such that -1 corresponds to the last
    character, -2 to the next to last and so on.

### *Examples*

| a          | b    | c   | data       |
|------------|------|-----|------------|
| "Software" | 1    | 4   | "Soft"     |
| "Software" | \-4  | \-2 | "war"      |
| "Software" | 5    |     | "w"        |
| "Software" |      |     | "S"        |
| "Software" | 5    | 4   | ""         |
| "Software" | 6    | 50  | "are"      |
| "Software" | \-6  |     | "t"        |
| "Software" | \-99 | 99  | "Software" |

Find
----

Finds the starting position of string (b) inside string (a).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        _________
--->(a)|         |[index]-->
       |  FIND   |
--->(b)|         |
       |         |
--->(c)|         |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If (a) does not contains (b), returns zero.

If input (c) is present, it defines the initial character position in (a) where
the search must start.

Special Cases
-------------

-   If (b) is null (""), the search is always sucessfull for every string is
    considered to have a null character between its characters.

-   If (c) is negative, the starting search position is measured from the end of
    string (a), such that -1 corresponds to the last character, -2 to the next
    to last and so on.

### *Examples*

| a        | b     | c   | index |
|----------|-------|-----|-------|
| "Banana" | "ana" |     | 2     |
| "Banana" | "ban" |     | 0     |
| "Banana" | "Ban" |     | 1     |
| "Banana" | "ana" | 3   | 4     |
| "Banana" | "ana" | \-4 | 4     |
| "Banana" | "a"   | \-1 | 6     |
| "Banana" | "n"   |     | 3     |
| "Banana" | ""    |     | 1     |
| "Banana" | ""    | 1   | 1     |
| "Banana" | ""    | 3   | 3     |
| "Banana" | ""    | 7   | 0     |
