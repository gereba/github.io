## 2.1.2 Compound Values

A compound value, also known as **SoS** (*String of Strings*), is composed of an ordered sequence of strings or compound values.

Each element may be referenced by its position, starting at **1**.

If and element is also a compound value, its sub-elements may be referenced by its sub-position within the parent compound value. E.g., if the third element of a SoS is a compound value, its first element may be referenced as **3.1**, and so on.

### Compound Metapak

A *Compound Metapak* is a compound value which completely describes the structure and meaning of each compound value element. It is composed of the **compound name** followed by a sequence of **element** or **metapak** names, structured in the same way as the associated compound value it is bound to describe. 

A compound value may reference its associated compound metapak by prefixing its values with the **metapak name**.
