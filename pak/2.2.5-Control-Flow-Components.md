title: 2.2.5 PAK Control Flow Components
---

The fundamental components used to construct PAK Parts and Kits.

2.2.5 Control Flow
==================

Provide the mechanisms to control the execution sequence of components, such as:

-   **if** to select a path of execution based on a boolean value condition.

-   **loop** to repeat the computation of a subtree of components by a certain
    number of times an/or while a boolean condition holds true.

 

If
--

If the boolean value of input (a) is *true* then input (b) is selected as the
subtree to be executed to generate its output value (x).

Otherwise, if the boolean value of input (a) is *false* (zero valued), input (c)
is selected to be executed instead.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
          _________
-->(cond)|         |[x]-->
         |   IF    |
-->(true)|         |
         |         |
->(false)|         |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Either (b) or (c) is traversed, based on (a) *true* or *false* condition.

### *Examples*

| a       | b      | c       | x       |
|---------|--------|---------|---------|
| 1       | "Alfa" | "Bravo" | "Alfa"  |
| 375     | "Alfa" | "Bravo" | "Alfa"  |
| 3bravos | "Alfa" | "Bravo" | "Alfa"  |
| 2.05    | "Alfa" | "Bravo" | "Alfa"  |
| \-1     | "Alfa" | "Bravo" | "Alfa"  |
| "007"   | "Alfa" | "Bravo" | "Alfa"  |
| 0       | "Alfa" | "Bravo" | "Bravo" |
| ""      | "Alfa" | "Bravo" | "Bravo" |
| "?"     | "Alfa" | "Bravo" | "Bravo" |
| "Alfa"  | "Alfa" | "Bravo" | "Bravo" |

 

Loop
----

Repeats the computation of the subtree of components that feed its input (a),
starting from one up to an upper limit defined by its input (b) certain number
of times an/or while a boolean condition holds true.

-   Input (*limit*) is required and defines the *limit* value of the loop
    repetition counter.

-   Input (*start*) is optional and defines the *starting from* value of the
    repetition counter.

-   Input (*while*) is optional and if present, its boolean value is checked at
    the beginning of each repetition cycle: *while true* the cycle is performed,
    otherwise the loop is terminated.

-   [FUTURE] Input (enum) is optional and enumerates the values to be assumed by
    the loop counter at each cycle.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
          _________
----->(a)|         |[x]-->
         |  LOOP   |
->(limit)|         |
         |         |
->(start)|         |
         |         |
->(while)|         |
         |         |
-->(enum)|         |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 

While the loop is active, its output (x) assumes for each cycle the immediate
value of its cycle counter and can be used as input value for other components
within the looping subtree, as long as it is accessed via the interim component.

When the loop ends, its output (x) assumes the final value of its subtree root
component (a).

Although all are optional, the inputs (*start*), (while) and (*enum*) can be
used simultaneously. [FUTURE] In this case, (enum) takes precedence and is
cycled before the

 

### *Examples*

In this example, the loop component is used to help find the position of the
**i-th** repeating *letter* in a given *string*.

The loop repeats the **find** component sucessively starting the search at the
next position from the previous found letter, until the loop limit is reached
and the position of the desired i-th letter is outputed. - the **interim**
component grabs the **find** output as is, before the find computation is
updated, thus is used to feed back into the find component a new starting
position input (c) for each search cycle. - the **loop** while input (d) is used
to stop the loop if there are less repetitions than the desired order fed into
its limit input (b).
